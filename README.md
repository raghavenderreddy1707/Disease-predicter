🩺 Disease Predictor

A Machine Learning based web/notebook application that predicts the likelihood of a disease based on user-provided symptoms. This project leverages data-driven models to provide quick preliminary health insights and help users understand potential risks before consulting a doctor.

🚀 Features

Input symptoms to get predicted disease.

Trained with symptom–disease datasets.

Interactive and user-friendly interface (via Jupyter Notebook or extendable to Streamlit/Flask).

Supports multiple diseases with accurate predictions.

Easily extendable with new datasets and models.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas – Data preprocessing

numpy – Numerical computations

scikit-learn – Machine Learning models

matplotlib / seaborn – Visualization

⚙️ Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/disease_predictor.git
cd disease_predictor


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the notebook:

jupyter notebook Disease_Predictor.ipynb

📊 Workflow

Load dataset (symptoms → diseases).

Preprocess and clean the data.

Train ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, etc.).

Predict disease based on user-input symptoms.

Display results.

🖥️ Example Usage

Enter symptoms: ['itching', 'skin_rash', 'nodal_skin_eruptions']

Output prediction: "Fungal infection"

📌 Future Enhancements

Build a Streamlit/Flask web app for better UI.

Add confidence scores for predictions.

Include preventive measures and treatments along with disease prediction.

Expand dataset for broader disease coverage.
